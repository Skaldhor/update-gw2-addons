3. create a scheduled task to run the script automatically every day/reboot/whenever you want
4. make sure to run the script with elevated rights if your user doesn't have the rights to modify the GW2 folder
5. if you enable automatically checking for updates the script must be run in user context, so if you created a scheduled task for it, make sure to set it to "Run only when user is logged on". Otherwise you won't see the textbox telling you about it.
